## Different Type of Tree
1. Full binary tree ---> all nodes are occupied
2. Complete binary tree ---> only missing left nodes
3. Binary search tree   ---> left / right node are smaller / larger than root node
   
## Ways to Traverse Tree
1. depth first search  
    determine by root node
    * pre-order
    * in-order
    * post-order
3. breadth first search
